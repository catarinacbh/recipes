    1. Add the coconut oil and onions to a pan. Cook on medium heat until tender.

    5. Place 80g of the cooked peas with 2 tablespoons of water in a food processor. Blend until puréed.
    6. When the rice is cooked remove from the heat and add the basil.
    7. Add the pea purée and the 250g of fresh peas to the rice. Mix well until combined.
    8. Serve with a drizzle of olive oil and grated parmesan cheese.
