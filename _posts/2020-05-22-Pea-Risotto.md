    1. In a pan on a medium heat, add the coconut oil and onions. Let it cook until tender.
    2. Add the rice and mix with the oil and onion to coat the grains in oil.
    3. Add the vegetable stock and stir it while letting it simmer. It should take approximately 20 minutes for the rice to be absorbed.

    6. When the rice is cooked remove from the heat and add the basil.
    7. Add to the rice the pea puree and the 250g of fresh peas. Mix well until combined.
    8. Serve with a drizzle of olive oil and grated parmesan cheese.
