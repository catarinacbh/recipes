    1. Pre-heat oven to 180ÂºC. Grease two springforms.
    For the cake
    2. Combine the flour, bicarbonate of soda, cocoa powder and salt in a bowl.
    3. Mix the milk and the lemon juice. Add this to the dry ingridients gradually while mixing.
    4. Beat in your desired amount of food coloring just until combined. I use 3 teaspoons of red food colouring.
    5. In a separate bowl, whisk together the butter and sugar until combined. Add the oil, egg yolks, vanilla extract and combine together with the butter and sugar.
    7. Combine both mixtures together.
    8. In a separate bowl, vigorously whisk the 4 egg whites until fluffy peaks form, about 4 minutes. Gently fold into cake the mixture.
    9. Divide the cake mixture between cake pans. Bake for 30-32 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove cakes from the oven and let it cool completely on a wire rack. The cakes must be cool before frosting.
    For the frosting
   10. In a bowl, whisk the cream cheese and butter together until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the icing sugar, full-fat milk, vanilla extract, and salt. Beat until combined and creamy. Add more icing sugar if frosting is too thin, more milk if frosting is too thick, or an extra pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet.
   Assembling
   11. Place 1 cake layer on your serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and spread remaining frosting on the top and sides.
   12. Refrigerate cake for at least 30 minutes before serving. This will help the cake hold when cutting.
