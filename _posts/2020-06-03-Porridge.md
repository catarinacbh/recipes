    1. In a pan, place the oats, milk, vanilla extract, ground cinnamon and salt.
    2. Bring to boil and let it simmer until the porridge becomes thicker. This should take around 5 minutes unless you prefer the porridge runnier. Make sure you continuously stir so no lumps are formed.
    3. Pour into a bowl. For the topping, include the saturn peach or berries, sprinkle with cinnamon and honey. Spoon the yogurt if using it.
    6. Ready to be served.
